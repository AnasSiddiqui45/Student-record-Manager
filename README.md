# Student-record-Manager
This project is a basic console-based Student Marks Management System built using Python lists and functions to perform CRUD operations. It stores student names and marks in two parallel lists, where the index position is the only link between related data, which makes the design simple but fragile and error-prone. The program allows users to insert new records, update marks, delete students, and display individual or all records through separate functions. While the core logic correctly demonstrates list manipulation, indexing, and conditional checks, the overall structure is rigid because functions are executed immediately without a menu-driven flow, giving users no control over operation order. Error handling and input validation are minimal, so invalid inputs can easily crash the program. A major logical flaw exists in the delete operation, where the name is removed but the corresponding mark is not, risking data inconsistency. The system has no persistence, scalability, or abstraction, making it unsuitable for real-world use. However, it effectively serves its intended purpose as a beginner-level project to practice Python fundamentals, control flow, and basic data management concepts.
